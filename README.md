# di
- GTK frontend UI for div.is.

## TODO
- [ ] Extract model implementation details from dlog, dsrv (old + new), etc. and make into a generic crate which carries all common model specification and functioanlity definition so I do not need to re-implement for every project I start related to this. 12/26
- [ ] Decide on GUI framework for final build -- Tauri? Qt (quick/widgets)? Iced? GTK? Electron?
